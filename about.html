    <p> when i was six years old i was forced to eat bugs. i lived in a siberian work camp where my babushka would spray my knuckles with dog medicine so my fists were harder so i could be a bare knuckle boxer. at age 8 i broke out of the camp and lived with wolves for 36 years. i am now 12 and have seen things no other man has seen.</p>
