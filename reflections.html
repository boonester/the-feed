    <p> As much as I wish I could say I use the internet for anything else, generally my internet usage is for
        entertainment and to shut the brain up. The internet has become really good at sucking you in and subsequently
        sucking your brains out and quite frankly I’ve had my brains ripped out by the content machine quite a few
        times. Even while writing this I’m fighting the urge to forfeit my brains just so that I can dodge my
        responsibilities some more. While I may sometimes be given something of worth, like videos on linguistics and
        history that develop my love for the world, the majority of what I feel forced to watch is slop. But it is
        designed this way. Short form content sites don’t need you to like the content or the habit, they just need you
        to keep doing it.

        In practically all the screenshots I was doing school work or actively in class. Everything is online now which
        includes class. I know that last sentence dives so deep and digs up a lot about this world that no one realizes
        so try to keep your mind in one piece after I say such perplexing and surprising things like school being
        online.

        I think the internet needs to collapse to be rebuilt. Everything has gone to shit quite frankly and one day everyone else will
        stop seeing endless pop ups and ads designed to take advantage of you as a
        necessary evil to keep the internet going. Every website or app is becoming buggier and buggier and less user
        friendly but nobody seems to care because we are all junkies. Every day the internet feels more and more like
        nuclear science, where instead of its discovery and creation starting a nuclear powered revolution where
        everything is green and efficient, we chose to make bombs. In this timeline there is a possible future where in
        between breathing in nuclear fallout and coal plant polluted air I can watch a 30 second clip of a world famous
        streamer that nobody knew about until yesterday interrupted by 2 minutes of ads for AI girlfriends and tax
        relief scams. In fact, we’re basically there sin nuclear fallout.

    <p>The contrast of life online and offline is still one we have to understand. I think too many people see too much
        of a distinction between the two in an ever increasingly online world. Many may think their online postings and
        ramblings and such are distinct from the person they present themselves as in the real world without connecting
        that they come from the same place. It is this distinction that gives people the false sense of comfort that
        they can have a life where they present as normal and a life online where they are raging incels microdosing
        terrorism. But that distinction could only be made in a severance type world where the conscious isn't working
        overtime trying to bounce between both worlds that both exist in the subconscious. Someone may consciously think
        one way online and another offline but the subconscious thinks both ways all the time and online behavior will
        always manifest itself offline eventually.

        There is also somewhat of an expectation to uphold this separation.
        There is the fear of coming off as “terminally online” to friends, family, and co-workers that stops people from
        connecting through internet topics. Here's an anecdote. The county I grew up in has its own meme page that like
        many topic based meme pages has devolved into a space for the admins own life, opinions, and vanity. When
        visiting home, I saw them at the main flea market in north county and approached them. What followed was one
        of the most awkward interactions with someone who when online is rather unabashed, solely because the gap between
        online and offline life was bridged.
